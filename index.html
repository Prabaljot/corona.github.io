            <p>
                Government of India is taking all necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared well to face the
                challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID 19 – the Corona Virus. With active
                support of the people of India, we have been able to contain the spread of the Virus in our country.
                The most important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens
                with the right information and taking precautions as per the advisories being issued by Ministry of
                Health & Family Welfare.

            <h2>#FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <details>
                <summary><b>Question 1 : </b>What is COVID-19?<br></summary>
                <p><b>Answer : </b>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19
            have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get
            better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are
            a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks
            after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain
            underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against
            COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>
            </details><br>
            <details>
                <summary><b>Question 2 : </b>What is community spread?<br></summary>
                <p><b>Answer : </b>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including
                    some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community
                    spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please
                    visit your local health department's website.<br><br>
            </details><br>

            <details><summary><b>Question 3 : </b>Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?<br></summary>
            <b>Answer : </b>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the
            disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new
            name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, “CO” stands for
            corona, “VI” for virus, and ”D” for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel
            coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”</details><br>

            <details><summary><b>Question 4 : </b>How does the virus spread?</summary><br>
            <b>Answer : </b>COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person,
            including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are
            infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with
            COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the
            severity of illness it causes.
            COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can
            vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as
            efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.
            For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads page to learn how
            COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself.</details><br>

            <details><summary><b>Question 5 : </b>Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?<br></summary>
            <b>Answer : </b>Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the
            virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or
            international mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by
            touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
            possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

            <details><summary><b>Question 6 : </b>Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19?<br></summary>
                <b>Answer : </b>Yes. CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at events and gatherings,
                and anywhere they will be around other people. When you wear a mask, you protect others as well as
                yourself. Masks work best when everyone wears one. A mask is NOT a substitute for social distancing.
                Masks should still be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when indoors around
                people who don't live in your household.
                Effective February 2, 2021, masks are required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public
                transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such
                as airports and stations.
    
                While masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific
                instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, adaptations and alternatives
                should be considered whenever possible.</details><br>
                <details><summary><b>Question 7 : </b>Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?<br></summary>
                    <b>Answer : </b>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar
                    coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to
                    person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.</details><br>

            <details><summary><b>Question 8 : </b>How can I protect myself?<br></summary>

                COVID-19.</details><br>

            <details><summary><b>Question 9 : </b>Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?<br></summary>
            <b>Answer : </b>Continue taking care of your health and wellness
            Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare
            provider.
            Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you.
            Have at least a 2-week supply of all prescription and non-prescription medications.
            Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventative services are up
            to date.
            Call your healthcare provider
            if you have any concerns about your medical conditions, or if you get sick.
            to find out about different ways you can connect with your healthcare provider for chronic disease
            management or other conditions.
            If you must visit in-person, protect yourself and others.
            Do not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or any underlying medical condition that
            requires immediate attention.
            If you need emergency help, call 911.
            Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you... <a

            <details><summary><b>Question 10 : </b>Is it okay for me to donate blood?<br></summary>
            <b>Answer : </b>In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving,
            essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are
            open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if
            they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting
            blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these
            recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning
            practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.</details><br>
